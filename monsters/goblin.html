        <h1>Goblin Warrior</h1>
        <p>
            Scrawny, spiteful, numble, and intelligent, a Goblin's insticnt for self preservation should never be
            underestimated.
            Though cowardly, Goblins readily band together if this secures an overwhelming advantage in numbers.
            Goblins frequently join with Orc armies (not always by choice) opportunistically helping themeselves to the
            spoils of war while others do most of the actual fighting.

            <p>
                The goblin must attempt a <b>Wp</b> test when faced with an elvish adversary.
                If the test fails then the goblin suffers -1 SL on all tests against them.
                The goblin may not move closer without passing another <b>Wp</b> test.
                If the elf moves closer to the goblin during this effect then another <b>Wp</b> test is needed to
                avoid the goblin becoming broken.
